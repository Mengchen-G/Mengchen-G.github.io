                The design and ideas show up in today's shopping cart are the wider handle, the size of the cart and higher portion of plastic usage. For my experience, Target's shopping cart has wider handle that you can put drink in and the same time provide kids a bigger surface. As I notices, the size of their final prototype is pretty big that can contain 3 basket on one side, shopping carts now, especially the ones in Target and Ikea are big, which are not like majority of the original shopping carts. Then the usage of plastic to reduce the weight of the cart for easier control.

                4 main ideas I saw didn't make to today's shopping cart are the baskets in the cart with the hook, kids seat, portable price-checking/calculator on the cart, and the multi-directional wheel. For baskets usage in the super market, when people chose to take a basket means that they don't have much things they need to buy. Adding multiple basket in a big shopping cart is too much work. When people go to supermarket, its extra steps you need to load your cart with basket first. In addition, grab the basket and leave the cart will have unattended belonging issues and the common space will be a mess as well. Second issue: kids seat. In my opinion, it is not safe for the design they have, if parents can lift the handle to put kids in, kids might accidently lift the handle themselves that cause security issues. Third, tech on the cart. It is a very nice thought that people can check the price whenever they need and then add them up when they decide to buy, but the problem is it is very easy to lose that it is too small and easier to got stolen. Also high maintenance, need to charge it, put it back and check if the machine is broken. As for multi direction wheel, it is convienent but might not be safe when staff are carring dozen of cart at the same time or when the floor is slanted and kids are inside. Also I think the super market are normally build in the way that the original wheel words just fine.

                Groups of people design team talked to are people who made shopping cart, who use shopping carts and who manange shopping carts. It's very important to have conversation with them because they are the "experts" in that field. Compare to staring at the product itself, go out and do a field study, asking people who use it manage daily to see what kind of problems they are facing for the hours of times they are using it. It's important to step out of our own thought box and to see what people are experiencing, problems exists that we they might take for granted or didn't even thought of.
